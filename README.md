# Brain_Tumor_Detection_Using_CNN
This project aims to detect possible glioma, meningioma, pituitary type tumor, or absence of any cancer in the human brain

This is my first project in the deep learning domain. It also aims to enhance
and cultivate my deep learning practical implementation skills by building CNN
model from scratch by researching and studying its different layers.
